- Plugin based system, utilizing a similar approach to Arch Linux, starting with an extremely minimal system and enabling the user to "build" it from the ground up for their server
- Possiblity to easily create and distribute add-ons for the bot, utilizing Discord.JS, giving users a familair base to work off of.
